# CupcakeCorner

APP: CupcakeCorner

Description: An application created as part of the "100 Days of SwiftUI" course. The essence of the application is an imitation of ordering pancakes from a restaurant or store. The application consists of several windows - the pancake settings window, the delivery address selection window and the final order confirmation window. For the first time in the entire course, URLSession, URLRequest and async-await were applied.
